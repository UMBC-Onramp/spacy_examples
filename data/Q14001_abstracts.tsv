Staog was the first computer virus written for the Linux operating system. It was discovered in the autumn of 1996, and the vulnerabilities that it exploited were fixed soon after. It has not been detected in the wild since its initial outbreak. Staog was able to infect Linux despite its security-oriented design which requires users and programs to log in as root before any drastic operations can be taken. It worked by exploiting some kernel vulnerabilities to stay resident. Then, it would infect executed binaries. Since it relied on fundamental bugs, software upgrades made systems immune to Staog. This, combined with its shot in the dark method of transmitting itself, ensured that it died off rather quickly. Staog was written in assembly language by the hacker group ./nBrain is the industry standard name for a computer virus that was released in its first form in 19 January 1986, and is considered to be the first computer virus for the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) and compatibles./nKenzero is a computer virus that is spread across peer-to-peer networks and is programmed to monitor the browsing history of victims./nThe Stars virus is a computer virus which infects computers running Microsoft Windows. It was named and discovered by Iranian authorities in April 2011. Iran claimed it was used as a tool to commit espionage. Western researchers came to believe it is probably the same thing as the Duqu virus, part of the Stuxnet attack on Iran./nBliss is a computer virus, introduced in 1997, which aims to infect Linux systems. When executed, it attempts to attach itself to Linux executable files, to which regular users do not have access. In the case of the alpha version, this prevents the executables from running, so users notice it immediately. Although it was probably intended to prove that Linux can be infected, it does not propagate very effectively because of the structure of Linux's user privilege system. The Bliss virus never became widespread, and remains chiefly a research curiosity. After the Staog virus it is the second known Linux virus. When the Bliss virus was released, antivirus software vendors and Linux distributions released security advisories to notify users of the potential risks.Debian still lists itself as vulnerable to the Bliss virus. However, due to the requirement for infection to occur under the root user, the risk is listed as minimal./nCIH, also known as Chernobyl or Spacefiller, is a Microsoft Windows 9x computer virus which first emerged in 1998. Its payload is highly destructive to vulnerable systems, overwriting critical information on infected system drives, and in some cases destroying the system BIOS. The virus was created by Chen Ing-hau (陳盈豪, pinyin: Chén Yíngháo) who was a student at Tatung University in Taiwan. Sixty million computers were believed to be infected by the virus internationally, resulting in an estimated US$1 billion in commercial damages. Chen claimed to have written the virus as a challenge against bold claims of antiviral efficiency by antivirus software developers. Chen stated that after the virus was spread across Tatung University by classmates, he apologized to the school and made an antivirus program available for public download; the antivirus program was co-authored with Weng Shi-hao (翁世豪), a student at Tamkang University. Prosecutors in Taiwan could not charge Chen at the time because no victims came forward with a lawsuit. These events led to new computer crime legislation in Taiwan. The name "Chernobyl Virus" was coined some time after the virus was already well known as CIH, and refers to the complete coincidence of the payload trigger date in some variants of the virus (actually the virus creation date in 1998, to trigger exactly a year later) and the Chernobyl disaster, which happened in the Soviet Union on April 26, 1986. The name "Spacefiller" was introduced because most viruses write their code to the end of the infected file, with infected files being detectable because their file size increases. In contrast to this, CIH looks for gaps in the existing program code, where it then writes its own code. This does not increase the file size and in that way helps the virus avoid detection./nFlame, also known as Flamer, sKyWIper, and Skywiper, is a modular computer malware discovered in 2012 that attacks computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system. The program is being used for targeted cyber espionage in Middle Eastern countries. Its discovery was announced on 28 May 2012 by MAHER Center of Iranian National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), Kaspersky Lab and CrySyS Lab of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The last of these stated in its report that Flame "is certainly the most sophisticated malware we encountered during our practice; arguably, it is the most complex malware ever found." Flame can spread to other systems over a local network (LAN). It can record audio, screenshots, keyboard activity and network traffic. The program also records Skype conversations and can turn infected computers into Bluetooth beacons which attempt to download contact information from nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices. This data, along with locally stored documents, is sent on to one of several command and control servers that are scattered around the world. The program then awaits further instructions from these servers. According to estimates by Kaspersky in May 2012, Flame had initially infected approximately 1,000 machines, with victims including governmental organizations, educational institutions and private individuals. At that time 65% of the infections happened in Iran, Israel, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, with a "huge majority of targets" within Iran. Flame has also been reported in Europe and North America. Flame supports a "kill" command which wipes all traces of the malware from the computer. The initial infections of Flame stopped operating after its public exposure, and the "kill" command was sent. Flame is linked to the Equation Group by Kaspersky Lab. However, Costin Raiu, the director of Kaspersky Lab's global research and analysis team, believes the group only cooperates with the creators of Flame and Stuxnet from a position of superiority: "Equation Group are definitely the masters, and they are giving the others, maybe, bread crumbs. From time to time they are giving them some goodies to integrate into Stuxnet and Flame." In 2019, researchers Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade and Silas Cutler announced their discovery of the resurgence of Flame. The attackers used 'timestomping' to make the new samples look like they were created before the 'suicide' command. However, a compilation error included the real compilation date (circa 2014). The new version (dubbed 'Flame 2.0' by the researchers) includes new encryption and obfuscation mechanisms to hide its functionality./nAmbulance or Ambulance Car is a computer virus that infected computers running a DOS operating system in June 1990. It was discovered in Germany./nThe Cascade virus (also known as Herbstlaub in Germany) is a prominent computer virus that was a resident written in assembly language, that was widespread in the 1980s and early 1990s. It infected .COM files and had the effect of making text on the screen fall (or cascade) down and form a heap at the bottom of the screen. It was notable for using an encryption algorithm to avoid being detected. However, one could see that infected files had their size increased by 1701 or 1704 bytes. In response, IBM developed its own antivirus software. The virus has a number of variants. Cascade-17Y4, which is reported to have originated in Yugoslavia, is almost identical to the most common 1704 byte variant. One byte has been changed, probably due to a random "mutation". This, however, has resulted in a "bug" in the virus. Another mutated variant is also known - it infects the same file over and over./nElk Cloner is one of the first known microcomputer viruses that spread "in the wild", i.e., outside the computer system or laboratory in which it was written. It attached itself to the Apple II operating system and spread by floppy disk. It was written around 1982 by programmer and entrepreneur Rich Skrenta as a 15-year-old high school student, originally as a joke, and put onto a game disk./nJerusalem is a logic bomb DOS virus first detected at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in October 1987. On infection, the Jerusalem virus becomes memory resident (using 2kb of memory), and then infects every executable file run, except for COMMAND.COM. COM files grow by 1,813 bytes when infected by Jerusalem and are not re-infected. Executable files grow by 1,808 to 1,823 bytes each time they are infected, and are then re-infected each time the files are loaded until they are too large to load into memory. Some .EXE files are infected but do not grow because several overlays follow the genuine .EXE file in the same file. Sometimes .EXE files are incorrectly infected, causing the program to fail to run as soon as it is executed. The virus code itself hooks into interrupt processing and other low level DOS services. For example, code in the virus suppresses the printing of console messages if, for example, the virus is not able to infect a file on a read-only device such as a floppy disk. One of the clues that a computer is infected is the mis-capitalization of the well-known message "Bad command or file name" as "Bad Command or file name". The Jerusalem virus is unique among other viruses of the time, as it is a logic bomb, set to go off on Friday the 13th on all years but 1987. Once triggered, the virus not only deletes any program run that day, but also infects .EXE files repeatedly until they grow too large for the computer. This particular feature, which was not included in all of Jerusalem's variants, is triggered 30 minutes after the system is infected, significantly slows down the infected computer, thus allowing for easier detection. Jerusalem is also known as "BlackBox" because of a black box it displays during the payload sequence. If the system is in text mode, Jerusalem creates a small black rectangle from row 5, column 5 to row 16, column 16. Thirty minutes after the virus is activated, this rectangle scrolls up two lines. As a result of the virus hooking into the low-level timer interrupt, PC-XT systems slow down to one fifth of their normal speeds 30 minutes after the virus has installed itself, though the slowdown is less noticeable on faster machines. The virus contains code that enters a processing loop each time the processor's timer tick is activated. Symptoms also include spontaneous disconnection of workstations from networks and creation of large printer spooling files. Disconnections occur since Jerusalem uses the 'interrupt 21h' low-level DOS functions that Novell NetWare and other networking implementations required to hook into the file system. Jerusalem was initially very common (for a virus of the day) and spawned a large number of variants. However, since the advent of Windows, these DOS interrupts are no longer used, so Jerusalem and its variants have become obsolete./nExtended Copy Protection (XCP) is a software package developed by the British company First 4 Internet (which on 20 November 2006, changed its name to Fortium Technologies Ltd) and sold as a copy protection or digital rights management (DRM) scheme for Compact Discs. It was used on some CDs distributed by Sony BMG and sparked the 2005 Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal; in that context it is also known as the Sony rootkit. Security researchers, beginning with Mark Russinovich in October 2005, have described the program as functionally identical to a rootkit: a computer program used by computer intruders to conceal unauthorised activities on a computer system. Russinovich broke the story on his Sysinternals blog, where it gained attention from the media and other researchers. This ultimately led to a civil lawsuit and criminal investigations, which forced Sony to discontinue use of the system. While Sony eventually recalled the CDs that contained the XCP system, the web-based uninstaller was investigated by noted security researchers Ed Felten and Alex Halderman, who stated that the ActiveX component used for removing the software exposed users to far more significant security risks, including arbitrary code execution from websites on the internet./n/n/n/nRogue security software is a form of malicious software and internet fraud that misleads users into believing there is a virus on their computer and aims to convince them to pay for a fake malware removal tool that actually installs malware on their computer. It is a form of scareware that manipulates users through fear, and a form of ransomware. Rogue security software has been a serious security threat in desktop computing since 2008. Two of the earliest examples to gain infamy were BraveSentry and SpySheriff./n/nCabir (also known as Caribe, SybmOS/Cabir, Symbian/Cabir and EPOC.cabir) is the name of a computer worm developed in 2004 that is designed to infect mobile phones running Symbian OS. It is believed to be the first computer worm that can infect mobile phones. When a phone is infected with Cabir, the message "Caribe" is displayed on the phone's display, and is displayed every time the phone is turned on. The worm then attempts to spread to other phones in the area using wireless Bluetooth signals. The worm was not sent out into the wild, but sent directly to anti-virus firms, who believe Cabir in its current state is harmless. However, it does prove that mobile phones are also at risk from virus writers. Experts also believe that the worm was developed by a group who call themselves , a group of international hackers, as a "proof of concept" worm in order to catch world attention. Several firms subsequently released tools to remove the worm, the first of which was the Australian business TSG Pacific. The worm can attack and replicate on Bluetooth enabled Series 60 phones. The worm tries to send itself to all Bluetooth enabled devices that support the "Object Push Profile", which can also be non-Symbian phones, desktop computers or even printers. The worm spreads as a .sis file installed in the Apps directory. Cabir does not spread if the user does not accept the file-transfer or does not agree with the installation, though some older phones would keep on displaying popups, as Cabir re-sent itself, rendering the UI useless until yes is clicked. Cabir is the first mobile malware ever discovered While the worm is considered harmless because it replicates but does not perform any other activity, it will result in shortened battery life on portable devices due to constant scanning for other Bluetooth enabled devices. Cabir was named by the employees of Kaspersky Lab after their colleague Elena Kabirova. Mabir, a variant of Cabir, is capable of spreading not only via Bluetooth but also via MMS. By sending out copies of itself as a .sis file over cellular networks, it can affect even users who are outside the 10m range of Bluetooth./n3wPlayer is malware that disguises itself as a Media player. It can infect computers running Microsoft Windows. It is designed to exploit users who download video files, instructing them to download and install the program in order to view the video. The 3wPlayer employs a form of social engineering to infect computers. Seemingly desirable video files, such as recent movies, are released via BitTorrent or other distribution channels. These files resemble conventional AVI files, but are engineered to display a message when played on most media player programs, instructing the user to visit the 3wPlayer website and download the software to view the video. The 3wPlayer is infected with Trojan.Win32.Obfuscated.enAccording to Symantec, 3wPlayer "may download" a piece of adware they refer to as Adware.Lop, which "adds its own toolbar and search button to Internet Explorer". A Perl script posted online can reportedly decrypt 3wplayer files back into AVI. This claim has been tested with mixed results, as the intended AVI file is rarely the desired video file. Some developers have made an application to automatically identify 3wPlayer encrypted files./nSpySheriff is malware that disguises itself as anti-spyware software. It attempts to mislead the user with false security alerts, threatening them into buying the program. Like other rogue antiviruses, after producing a list of false threats, it prompts the user to pay to remove them. The software is particularly difficult to remove, since it nests its components in System Restore folders, and also blocks some system management tools. However, SpySheriff can be removed by an experienced user, antivirus software, or by using a rescue disk./nMahdi is computer malware that was initially discovered in February 2012 and was reported in July of that year. According to Kaspersky Lab and Seculert (an Israeli security firm which discovered the malware), the software has been used for targeted cyber espionage since December 2011, infecting at least 800 computers in Iran and other Middle Eastern countries. Mahdi is named after files used in the malware and refers to the Muslim figure./nAda is a computer virus that can affect any of the DOS operating systems. Ada was first discovered in 1991./nABC, discovered in October 1992, is a memory-resident, file-infecting computer virus which infects EXE files and may alter both COM and EXE files. ABC activates on the 13th day of every month. Upon infection, ABC becomes memory-resident at the top of system memory but below the 640K DOS boundary and hooks interrupts 16 and 1C. The copy of command.com pointed to by the COMSPEC environment variable may also be altered. ABC infects/alters COM and EXE files as they are executed. After infection, total system memory, as measured by the DOS CHKDSK program, will not be altered, but available free memory will have decreased by approximately 8,960 bytes. Altered, but not infected, COM or EXE files will have 4 to 30 bytes added to their length. Infected EXE files (COM files are never infected) have a file length increase of 2,952 to 2,972 bytes, and ABC is located at the end of the infected EXE. An altered/infected file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing may have been updated to the current system date and time when the file was altered/infected. No text strings are visible within the viral code in infected EXE files, but the following text strings are encrypted within the initial copy of the ABC virus: ABC_FFEAMinsk 8.01.92ABC ABC causes keystrokes on the compromised machine to be repeated. It seems double-letter combinations trigger this behavior, e.g. "book" becomes "boook [sic]". System hangs may also occur when some programs are executed, a likely side effect of ABC-induced corruption. The ABC virus is not to be confused with the ABC keylogger trojan, written in 2004 by Jan ten Hove./nAcid is a computer virus which infects .COM and .EXE files including command.com. Each time an infected file is executed, Acid infects all of the .EXE files in the current directory. Later, if an infected file is executed, it infects the .COM files in the current directory. Programs infected with Acid will have had the first 792 bytes of the host program overwritten with Acid's own code. There will be no file length increase unless the original host program was smaller than 792 bytes, in which case it will become 792 bytes in length. The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be altered. The following text strings are found in infected files: 
* "*.EXE *.COM .." 
* "Program too big to fit in memory" 
* "Acid Virus" 
* "Legalize ACiD and Pot" 
* "By: Copyfright Corp-$MZU"/nEliza is a computer virus discovered in December 1991. It infects COM files including COMMAND.COM. It has been reported that it is defective, yet destroys the .EXE files it creates. The .COM files are not deleted. To avoid detection, it does not alter the dates of files it infects, but increases their length by 1,193 or 1,194 bytes. It is also found in later versions of Windows./nZeus, ZeuS, or Zbot is a Trojan horse malware package that runs on versions of Microsoft Windows. While it can be used to carry out many malicious and criminal tasks, it is often used to steal banking information by man-in-the-browser keystroke logging and form grabbing. It is also used to install the CryptoLocker ransomware. Zeus is spread mainly through drive-by downloads and phishing schemes. First identified in July 2007 when it was used to steal information from the United States Department of Transportation, it became more widespread in March 2009. In June 2009 security company Prevx discovered that Zeus had compromised over 74,000 FTP accounts on websites of such companies as the Bank of America, NASA, Monster.com, ABC, Oracle, Play.com, Cisco, Amazon, and BusinessWeek. Similarly to Koobface, Zeus has also been used to trick victims of technical support scams into giving the scam artists money through pop-up messages that claim the user has a virus, when in reality they might have no viruses at all. The scammers may use programs such as Command prompt or Event viewer to make the user believe that their computer is infected./n/n/nCookie Monster was a program created in 1969 for several computer operating systems. The program was named after an obnoxious cartoon bear advertising cereal, but later became associated with the Muppet Cookie Monster. It started out as a way for computer users at Brown University to annoy their fellow students by manually sending messages blocking computer processes and demanding cookies until the user of the ransomed computer typed “cookie”. Though it is often called a virus, it does not self-replicate and spread, and so is considered a proto-virus, or simply malware instead. It is unrelated to the HTTP cookie. When C.D. Tavares heard the idea at MIT, he decided to automate it. Since then, the program has been shared on different operating systems. The automated program ran on PDP series minicomputers and was later replicated for Atari in two strains, called Cookie Monster Virus A and B. The only difference is that Virus B can survive a system reset if the system is not completely powered down. The Atari version has the same function as the original program, but this time pops up automatically in regular intervals, and sometimes appears ever more frequent as the program is "fed" more cookies. In order to remove the program completely, the user must type in "Oreo". In one version of the program, the demand for cookies would flash on the screen ever more rapidly until it would suddenly stop and print “I didn’t want a cookie anyway,” and then desist. The program inspired the movie Hackers to include a fictitious "Cookie Monster Virus" that "ate" the system data of a Gibson supercomputer. It was stopped (presumably only temporarily) when the system administrator typed "cookie"./n1260, or V2PX, was a demonstration computer virus written in 1989 by Mark Washburn that used a form of polymorphic encryption. Derived from Ralf Burger's publication of the disassembled Vienna Virus source code, the 1260 added a cipher and varied its signature by randomizing its decryption algorithm. Both the 1260 and Vienna infect .COM files in the current or PATH directories upon execution. Changing an authenticated executable file is detected by most modern computer operating systems./n4k is a computer virus which infects COM files and EXE files. The virus was one of the first file infectors to employ stealth tactics. Infected systems will hang, after September 22 every year, which is also the date of birth of Bilbo Baggins, a character from The Lord of the Rings. The code was intended to display the message Frodo Lives, but hangs in all known variants. This virus was spread without the aid of the Internet. It was ported between systems by floppy disks./nAI is a computer virus which infects executable files. The virus is loaded into memory by running an infected file and then modifies the computer's run time operation and corrupts program and overlay files. It doesn't seem to work with all executables but does reliably infect standard DOS files. AI adds useless bytes to the end of infected files/nAbraxas, also known as Abraxas5, discovered in April 1993, is an encrypted, overwriting, file infecting computer virus which infects .COM and .EXE files, although it does not infect command.com. It does not become memory resident. Each time an infected file is executed, Abraxas infects the copy of dosshell.com located in the C:\DOS directory (creating the file if it does not exist), as well as one EXE file in the current directory. Due to a bug in the virus, only the first EXE file in any directory is infected. Abraxas-infected files will become 1,171 bytes in length and contain Abraxas' viral code. The file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will be set to the system date and time when infection occurred. The following text strings can be found within the viral code in all Abraxas infected programs: "*.exe c:\dos\dosshell.com .. MS-DOS (c)1992" "->>ABRAXAS-5<<--" "...For he is not of this day" "...Nor he of this mind" Execution of infected programs will also result in the display of a graphic "ABRAXAS" on the system display, accompanied by an ascending scale being played on the system speaker. Abraxas was created with the virus creation tool, which can be used to create similar, easily detected viruses, which are usually encrypted as well. More than 20 viruses have appeared which have clearly been produced with the PS-MPC: 
* 
* 
* Abraxas (computer virus) 
* ARCV-n (computer virus) Remark: has also produced viruses with the and developed the ARCV strain. 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* The name "Abraxas" was also used for a virus in the video game Tron: Evolution./nAcme is a computer virus which infects MS-DOS EXE files. Each time an infected file is executed, Acme may infect an EXE in the current directory by creating a hidden 247 byte long read-only COM file with the same base name. (In MS-DOS, if the file extension is not specified, and two files with the same base name exist, one with .COM and one with .EXE, the .COM file will always be executed instead of the .EXE file.) Acme is a variant of , a spawning virus. Acme is also perhaps a descendant of the small single-step infector , which is not to be confused with the Zeno programming language./n/nAkbot was a computer virus that infected an estimated 1.3 million computers and added them to a botnet. It was created by an 18-year-old named Owen Walker, who was charged but unconvicted in 2008./nAlabama is a computer virus, discovered October 1989 on the campus of Hebrew University in Jerusalem./nAntiCMOS is a boot virus. Its first discovery was at Lenart, Slovenia, which led to its alias of Lenart. It was isolated in Hong Kong several times at the beginning of 1994, but did not become common until it spread to North America in the Spring of 1995. AntiCMOS is a fairly standard boot virus, and is primarily notable for being one of the few DOS viruses to remain in the wild as of 2020. AntiCMOS is so named because it has the intended effect of erasing all CMOS information. This does not occur because of a bug in the virus code. This is true of all AntiCMOS variants that have appeared in the wild. The payload date of December 1993 and the obsolete nature of these variants makes it very unlikely that AntiCMOS's payload will ever be a threat./nA web shell is a shell-like interface that enables a web server to be remotely accessed, often for the purposes of cyberattacks. A web shell is unique in that a web browser is used to interact with it. A web shell could be programmed in any programming language that is supported on a server. Web shells are most commonly written in the PHP programming language due to the widespread usage of PHP for web applications. However, Active Server Pages, ASP.NET, Python, Perl, Ruby, and Unix shell scripts are also used, although these languages are less commonly used. Using network monitoring tools, an attacker can find vulnerabilities that can potentially allow delivery of a web shell. These vulnerabilities are often present in applications that are run on a web server. An attacker can use a web shell to issue shell commands, perform privilege escalation on the web server, and the ability to upload, delete, download, and execute files to and from the web server./nBomber (also known as Commander Bomber) is a DOS polymorphic memory resident computer virus, known for its technique of "patchy infection". This method of infection is very similar to that which is utilised by the OneHalf computer virus. Contrary to the usual method of infecting executables (which is to append virus body to the executable and to change the entry point), it inserts several fragments ("patches") of its code in random places inside the file. These fragments transfer control to each other using various mechanisms. The method of infection makes the detection of the virus difficult by anti-virus programs, and it means that they would have to scan the file in its entirety in order to detect the virus. The size of the Bomber executable is approximately 4096 bytes and contains the following text: COMMANDER BOMBER WAS HERE [DAME] [DAME]/nLOP, or Live Online Portal, is malware that is installed on Microsoft Windows. Lop.com is a web site owned by C2Media LTD. It is a pay-per-click search portal where other websites will pay for each click to their sites via LOP. A method they used to get people to their site was to install a browser hijacker component on people's computers which would advertise their site through pop-ups. The installer could turn the user's web browser into a device with different links to lop.com. Older variants of LOP were quite predictable and installed Browser Helper Objects and startup entries with known names. Some later LOP variants used a string of pseudo-random words as their executable names and have been placing these executables in the user's application data directory. For example, there are LOP variants which call their file "meal dog house bone.exe"./nCTX is a computer virus created in Spain in 1999. CTX was initially discovered as part of the Cholera worm, with which the author intentionally infected with CTX. Although the Cholera worm had the capability to send itself via email, the CTX worm quickly surpassed it in prevalence. Cholera is now considered obsolete, while CTX remains in the field, albeit with only rare discoveries. In March 2006, CTX was in the news again due to a false positive in the McAfee VirusScan program that caused CTX detections in a range of innocuous files./nThe casino computer virus is a malicious virus that upon running the infected file, copies the File Allocation Tables (FATs) to random-access memory (RAM), then deletes the FAT from the hard disk. It challenges the user to a game of Jackpot of which they have 5 credits to play with, hence the name. No matter if they win or lose, the computer shuts down, thereby making them have to reinstall their DOS. The message it shows when it challenges you read(s): The casino computer virus activates on the 15th of January, April, August./nDexter is a computer virus or point of sale malware which infects computers running Microsoft Windows and was discovered by IT security firm Seculert, in December 2012. It infects PoS systems worldwide and steals sensitive information such as Credit Card and Debit Card information. In December 2013, researchers discovered StarDust, a major revision of Dexter, which compromised 20,000 cards in active campaign hitting US merchants.It was one of the first known botnets to target point-of-sale (PoS) terminals used by stores and restaurants to process customers' credit and debit card payments./nIn computing, Download.ject (also known as Toofer and Scob) is a malware program for Microsoft Windows servers. When installed on an insecure website running on Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), it appends malicious JavaScript to all pages served by the site. Download.ject was the first noted case in which users of Internet Explorer for Windows could infect their computers with malware (a backdoor and key logger) merely by viewing a web page. It came to prominence during a widespread attack starting June 23, 2004, when it infected many servers including several that hosted financial sites. Security consultants prominently started promoting the use of Opera or Mozilla Firefox instead of IE in the wake of this attack. Download.ject is not a virus or a worm; it does not spread by itself. The June 23 attack is hypothesised to have been put into place by automatic scanning of servers running IIS./nEGABTR (EGA for enhanced graphics adapter), sometimes pronounced "Eggbeater", was a Trojan horse program that achieved some level of notoriety in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Allegedly a graphics utility that would improve the quality of an EGA display, it actually was malware that deleted the file allocation tables on the hard drive. This deletion was accompanied by a text message reading "Arf! Arf! Got you!". Coverage about this virus has translated in languages such as German, Chinese and Indonesian. Various sources disagree as to the exact wording. In the 1980s, Richard Streeter, a CBS executive, once downloaded the Trojan virus, learned about EGABTR after visiting electronic Bulletin boards, hoping to find something to improve his operating system and unknowingly downloaded the virus./nFestering Hate (also known as hate) and CyberAIDS are the names of the first two Apple ProDOS viruses. CyberAIDS appears to have been a series of viruses with minor changes in the code, culminating in the final version called Festering Hate, which appeared in 1988 (The Festering Hate World Tour - Festering Hate in '88). When the virus went off, the title page credited "Rancid Grapefruit" and "Cereal Killer" of the "Kool/Rad Alliance!" The phone number embedded in the detonation page was apparently the home number of John Maxfield (also known as "Cable Pair") a well-known FBI informant and private investigator of the era, whose specialty was computer crime and hackers. Unlike the few Apple viruses that had come before, such as the Elk Cloner virus, that were essentially annoying but did no damage, the Festering Hate series of viruses was extremely destructive, spreading to all system files it could find on the host computer (hard drive, floppy and system memory) and then destroying everything when it could no longer find any uninfected files./nThe Fun.Exe virus is of the w32.Assarm family of computer viruses. According to Symantec it registers itself as a Windows system process then periodically sends mail with spreading attachments as a response to any unopened emails in Outlook Express.This virus first appeared in early 2008 and is now recognized by most anti virus programs./nGraphics Interchange Format Java Archives (GIFAR) is a term for GIF files combined with the JAR file format. GIFARs could be uploaded to Web sites that allow image uploading, and then run as though they were part of the legitimate code of that site. Java was patched in JRE 6 Update 11, with a CVE published on December 4 2008. In this attack, GIF Java archive files (GIFARs) were uploaded to Web sites on the understanding that they are GIFs, and the file was then interpreted as a JAR file when viewed and executed. This circumvented the same-origin policy that browsers impose; bypassing the content validation usually used. Attackers reference this malicious image in the applet code on the hosted site, establishing cross-domain communication with the (your) target domain. This technique worked because GIF images store their header in the beginning of the file, and JAR files (as with any ZIP archive-based format) store their data at the tail. This attack is not unique to GIFs and JARs; there is a general class of vulnerabilities of file type combinations such as .doc, .jpg, etc. A GIFAR allowed an attacker to access the victim's HTTP cookies. This allows session hijacking, where the victim's logged-in user accounts can be accessed. GIFARs should not have been executed if the user is viewing the image; it had to be interpreted as a JAR not a GIF to run. For the attack to work, the victim must be logged into the Web site that is hosting the image. Any site that includes login sessions with user-uploaded pictures can be vulnerable./nHuntBar, aka WinTools or Adware.Websearch, was installed by an ActiveX drive-by download at affiliate Web sites, or by advertisements displayed by other spyware programs — an example of how spyware can install more spyware. These programs add toolbars to Internet Explorer, track aggregate browsing behavior, redirect affiliate references, and display advertisements./n/nMDEF was a computer virus affecting Macintosh machines. There are four known strains. The first, MDEF A (aka Garfield), was discovered in May 1990. Strains B (aka Top Cat), C, and D were discovered in August 1990, October 1990, and January 1991, respectively. MDEF A, B, and C can infect application files and system files, and sometimes document files as well. The D strain will infect only applications. None of the viruses were designed to do damage, but they often do. MDEF D can sometimes damage applications beyond repair. Quick action by computer security personnel and the New York State Police resulted in identification of the author, a juvenile. This was the same person responsible for writing the virus./nThe MacMag virus, also known by various other names, was a computer virus introduced in 1988 by Richard Brandow, who at the time was editor and publisher of MacMag computer magazine in Montréal./nnVIR is an obsolete computer virus which can replicate on Macintosh computers running any System version from 4.1 to OS 8. The source code to the original nVIR has been made widely available, and so numerous variants have arisen. Each variant causes somewhat different symptoms, such as: application crashes, printing errors on laser printers, slow system response time, or unpredictable system crashes. nVIR spreads through any nVIR-infected program, but due to the long period of time nVIR lies basically dormant in a host system, nVIR generally finds its way into system backups and is not detected until the first overt symptoms appear. For example, if a disk used in an infected Macintosh is removed and inserted in a second Macintosh, the other machine will become infected if any application on that disk is executed in the second machine. Further, any method used to transfer programs between Macintoshes will spread nVIR, including file transfer over a network. However, nVIR cannot spread via a print network's hardware. nVIR carries an additional code resource, CODE 256 (though some variants carry CODE 255), and patches the jump table to point to it. The original application's entry point is saved in the nVIR 2 resource. nVIR introduces to the System file the INIT 32 resource which is executed at startup, at which time nVIR patches the TEInit trap. Any application subsequently calling this trap will be infected. The nVIR 3 (or nVIR 5) resource is a copy of INIT 32. An nVIR 10 resource in the System file will prevent nVIR infection. If an application calls OpenResFile prior to TEInit, that application will be damaged. nVIR 0 resource holds a counter that is set to 1000 on the first infection of the system. Each reboot decrements the counter by 1. Each application launch decrements it by 2. When the counter reaches 0, nVIR will beep 1 out of 8 reboots and 1 of 4 infected application launches. If MacinTalk is installed in the machine's System folder, the machine may occasionally say "Don't Panic". Otherwise, it may beep unexpectedly. nVIR has been known to 'hybridize' with different variants of nVIR on the same machine./nOntario is a family of computer virus, named after its point of isolation, the Canadian province of Ontario. This family of computer virus consists of Ontario.1024, Ontario.512 and Ontario.2048. The first variant Ontario.512 was discovered in July 1990. Because Ontario.1024 was also discovered in Ontario, it is likely that both viruses originate from within the province. By the Ontario.2048 variant, the author had adopted "Ontario" as the family's name and even included the name "Ontario-3" in the virus code./nThe SCA virus is the first computer virus created for the Commodore Amiga and one of the first to gain public notoriety. It appeared in November 1987. The SCA virus is a boot sector virus. It features a line of text that appears at every 15th copy after a warm reboot: Something wonderful has happened Your AMIGA is alive !!! and, even better... Some of your disks are infected by a VIRUS !!! Another masterpiece of The Mega-Mighty SCA !! "SCA" is an acronym for the Swiss Cracking Association, a group engaged in software protection removal, so the geographic origin of the virus was Switzerland. The virus is probably authored by an SCA member known as "CHRIS". SCA will not harm disks per se, but spreads to any write-enabled floppies inserted. If they use custom bootblocks (such as games), they are rendered unusable. SCA also checksums as an original filesystem (OFS) bootblock, hence destroying newer filesystems if the user doesn't know the proper use of the "install" command to remove SCA ("install df0: FFS FORCE" to recover a 'fast filesystem' floppy). The "Mega-Mighty SCA" produced the first Amiga virus checker which killed the SCA virus. This may well have been in response to estimates that approximately 40% of all Amiga users had SCA in their disk collection somewhere, due to rampant piracy. Other authors inspired by the harmless SCA virus would later produce more destructive viruses known as the Byte Bandit and the Byte Warrior. The first line of the infection message refers to the 1986 movie Short Circuit and the subsequent computer game with the line "Something wonderful has happened... No. 5 is alive."/nScores was a computer virus affecting Macintosh machines. It was first discovered in Spring 1988. It was written by a disgruntled programmer and specifically attacks two applications that were under development at his former company. These programs were never released to the public./nScott's Valley [sic] is a computer virus, a member of the virus family and distantly related to the Jerusalem virus family. It was discovered in September 1990 in Scotts Valley, California. It is named after the city of Scotts Valley, although that is spelled without an apostrophe./nSecurity Shield (also known as SecurityShield) is a series of rogue security software programs that asks for an amount of money to get the "full" version for protection against minor or non-existent viruses./nSevenDust is a computer virus that infects computers running certain versions of the classic Mac OS. It was first discovered in 1998, and originally referred to as 666 by Apple. SevenDust is a polymorphic virus, with some variant also being encrypted. It spreads by users running an infected executable. Some variants of SevenDust also delete all non-application files accessed during certain times./nShamoon (Persian: شمعون‎), also known as W32.DistTrack, is a modular computer virus that was discovered in 2012, targeting then-recent 32-bit NT kernel versions of Microsoft Windows. The virus was notable due to the destructive nature of the attack and the cost of recovery. Shamoon can spread from an infected machine to other computers on the network. Once a system is infected, the virus continues to compile a list of files from specific locations on the system, upload them to the attacker, and erase them. Finally the virus overwrites the master boot record of the infected computer, making it unusable. The virus was used for cyberwarfare against national oil companies including Saudi Arabia's Saudi Aramco and Qatar's RasGas. A group named "Cutting Sword of Justice" claimed responsibility for an attack on 30,000 Saudi Aramco workstations, causing the company to spend more than a week restoring their services. The group later indicated that the Shamoon virus had been used in the attack. Computer systems at RasGas were also knocked offline by an unidentified computer virus, with some security experts attributing the damage to Shamoon. It was later described as the "biggest hack in history". Symantec, Kaspersky Lab, and Seculert announced discovery of the malware on 16 August 2012. Kaspersky Lab and Seculert found similarities between Shamoon and the Flame malware. Shamoon made a surprise comeback in November 2016, January 2017, and December 2018./nWin32/Simile (also known as Etap and MetaPHOR) is a metamorphic computer virus written in assembly language for Microsoft Windows. The virus was released in its most recent version in early March 2002. It was written by the virus writer "Mental Driller". Some of his previous viruses, such as (which used the TUAREG polymorphic engine), have proved very challenging to detect. When the virus is first executed, it checks the current date. If the host file (the file that is infected with the virus) imports the file User32.dll, then on the 17th of March, June, September, or December, a message is displayed. Depending on the version of the virus, the case of each letter in the text is altered randomly. On 14 May (the anniversary of Israeli independence day), a message saying "Free Palestine!" will be displayed if the system locale is set to Hebrew. The virus then rebuilds itself. This metamorphic process is very complex and accounts for around 90% of the virus' code. After the rebuild, the virus searches for executable files in folders on all fixed and remote drives. Files will not be infected if they are located in a subfolder more than three levels deep, or if the folder name begins with the letter W. For each file that is found, there is a 50 percent chance that it will be ignored. Files will not be infected if they begin with F, PA, SC, DR, NO, or if the letter V appears anywhere in the file name. Due to the way in which the name matching is done, file names that contain certain other characters are also not infected, although this part is not deliberate. The virus contains checks to avoid infecting "goat" or "bait" files (files that are created by anti-virus programs). The infection process uses the structure of the host, as well as random factors, to control the placement of the virus body and the decryptor./nSunday is a computer virus (program file virus) , a member of the Jerusalem virus family. It was discovered in November 1989 after a number of simultaneous reports from Seattle, Washington, United States, and surrounding areas. Several other Seattle outbreaks, including , were later traced to Asia./nWestwood is a computer virus, a variant of the Jerusalem family, discovered August 1990, in Westwood, Los Angeles, California.The virus was isolated by a UCLA engineering student who discovered it in a copyof the "speed.com" program distributed with a new motherboard. Viral infection was first indicated when an early version of Microsoft Word reported internal checksum failure and failed to run./nThe Whale virus is a computer virus discovered on July 1, 1990. The file size, at 9,216 bytes, was for its time the largest virus ever discovered. It is known for using several advanced "stealth" methods./nZmist (also known as Z0mbie.Mistfall) is a metamorphic computer virus created by the Russian virus writer known as . It was the first virus to use a technique known as "code integration". In the words of and : This virus supports a unique new technique: code integration.The Mistfall engine contained in it is capable ofdecompiling Portable Executable files to [their] smallestelements, requiring 32 MB of memory. Zmist will insertitself into the code: it moves code blocks out of the way,inserts itself, regenerates code and data references, includingrelocation information, and rebuilds the executable./n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/nANTI is a computer virus affecting Apple Macintosh computers running classic Mac OS versions up to System 6. It was the first Macintosh virus not to create additional resources within infected files; instead, it patches existing CODE resources. The most commonly encountered strains of ANTI have only subtle effects, and thus can exist and spread indefinitely without being noticed until an antivirus application is run. Due to a bug in the virus, it cannot spread if MultiFinder is running, which prevents it from infecting System 7 and later versions of Mac OS as well as System 5 and 6 running MultiFinder./n/n
